----------------------Introduction--------------------------------

- Java is a object-oriented, general-purpose, high-level programming language.
  developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems and released in   1995.
- Oracle Corporation aquired SunMicrosystems in January 27, 2010.
- SunMicrosystem was conducting exams based on Java SCJP  (SunCertifiedJavaProffessional)
  Now Oracle conducting those exams in the name OCJP  (OracleCertifiedJavaProffessional)
- The Initial name of Java is Oak. Later they changed it to Java  (NameofTheCoffeeFlavour).
- you can use Java programming for developing mobile applications, enterprise web application, embedded systems Ex: Elevator(lift), WashingMachines, CarMusicPlayers, DeskTopApplications,BigDataTechnologies(DataProcessing) - ApacheHadoop and ApacheSpark(BigDataFrameworks), ScientificApplications, GameDevelopment. 

- Java Programming laguage is also called as Java platform.
- Java is a high level programming language.

- Open Sourcing: In 2006, Sun Microsystems released the source code of Java under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as OpenJDK, allowing developers to view, modify, and contribute to its development. 

High Level programming language
---------------------------------
-Programmer friendly
-easy to understand
Ex: C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby

Low Level Programming Language
----------------------------------
- Machine friendly
- difficult to understand
Note: Low level programming language provides a close representation of the hardware and allows direct control over the system's resources.

Ex: Assembly Language, COBOL, FORTRAN

- Machine can only understand 0s and 1s 

- Since computers can't able to understand high level programming languages, compilers and interpreters are used to for translation, translating from high level to machine level code.

Translators
------------
Converting the code from high level language to machine laguage.

Translators two types
--------------------
1. Compilers
2. Interpreters


Compilers VS Interpreters
---------------------------
1. Compiled Programming Languages -> C, C++, Java
2. Interpreted Programming Languge -> Python
3. In case of compilers: compiler takes the entire code at once and it will generate the machine level code.
4. In case of Interpreter: interpreter converts the high level laguage to the machine level code line by line. NOT AT ONCE

JAVA IS BOTH COMPILED AND INTERPRETED -> THAT WILL BE DECIDED BY THE JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

- JDK (software development kit) that includes everything needed to develop, compile and debug java applications, includes various development libraries.

-JRE (SoftwarePackage) provides necessary runtime environment for executing Java applications.it includes JVM as well.

-JVM - Provides an execution environment for JavaAppliations.

Summarry:: The JDK is used by developers for Java Application Development. The JRE is required for end-users to run JavaApplications, and the JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode and provides plarform independence.

- Java is object-oriented Programming Language NOT object-based
- Python is object based, Interpreted. Everything in case of python is object only.

-Java is Developed By James Gowsling in the year of 1995 while he was working at Sun Microsystems.
-The initial name of Java is Oak, Later they changed it to "Java" Java means, a flavor of coffee.

-James Gowsling is also called as Father of Java Programming Language.

Feature of Java programming Language
----------------------------------
1. Object Oriented
2. Platform Indepent
3. Secured
4. Auto Memory Management 
5. Exception Handling Mechanism
6. Multi-Threaded Programming Language
7. High Performance
8. Portable


1. Object Oriented
---------------
An object is a real world entity, that is having properties and behaviours.
Ex: Dog -> Object
    properties -> name, age, gender, weight, breed, color
    behaviours -> run, eat, sleep, bark, bite, chase a cat
This type of developement is not possible in case of C programming laguage(it is procedural language)

2. Platform Independent
-----------------------
Java is Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA) that means achitechture neutral.
This is possible because of Byte Code. 
Initially Java Compiler will compile the java program and produces a ".class" file.
Inside that .class file byte code will be available. that byte code (that .class file) is platform independent. 
There is an internal mechanism called JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is available inside the JDK(Java Development Kit) software itself.
The JVM will be converting that Byte code to the corresponding machine level code.
The byte code that we have developed by using any operating system, can ran on any other operating system. There is no need of changing anything to source code. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN CASE OF C
-JDK itself is not platform independent but the byte code is platform independent. 

3. Secured
-------------
- We can avoid security issue in case of Java, bcz in java there is no pointers concept.(in case of pointers concept, if we miss manage the memory by using pointers then there will be a securiy issue, hackers might breach the data and also pointers concept is very confusing) C PROGRAMMING LAGUAGE USES POINTERS BUT NOT JAVA
 
4. Auto Memory Management
-------------------------
- In case of Java There is a auto-memory management by using Garbage collector. 
 
5. Exception Handling Mechanism
----------------------------------
- To maintain the normal flow of execution we have Exception Handling
THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE IN C

6. Multi-Threaded Programming Language
--------------------------------------
- To increase the efficiency of the CPU and parallel execution. 
THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE IN C

7. High Performance
-------------------------------
- By using JIT(Just In-Time Compiler)

8. Portable
-----------
- Refere to Achitecture Neutrality (byte can be easily run on any platform) we can take the byte code and run it on any plaform.


- Most of the companies will be choosing Java to build their business applications.


The Lastest of Java is 20 

- The Latest edition of Java might not be supported by all the platforms(AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- The industry standard and which is supported by all the platforms is Java 8
- That is why we will download and install and work with Java 8
- We will be also learning about all the new features and new concepts that has been introduced in the latest editions of java.

Java SE - Standard Edition

Java SE Development Kit 8u371 
u == update

JDK software is available for 
---------------------
Linux
macOS
Solaris
Windows

According to the system architecture you need to select the installer
it can *86 (32 bit) or *64 (64 bit) operating system, or processor
 check - right click on this PC -> under system type you will find that.

*86 is compatible with only 32 bit system architecture if the system architecture is 32 bit only. 
if your system is 64 bit then both *86 and *64 is compatible.


select this file jdk-8u371-windows-x64.exe


Along with JDK software - > JRE and also JVM

JDK - Development purpose
JRE - Production purpose
JVM - Provides an environment to run(execute) byte code 

(Inside the JRE JVM will be there)

- Currently Java No.1 Development Platform(Business and Banking Applications)
- So many devices are running by using Java. Ex: Car Music Systems, lifts, Washing Machines(as embedded softwares), Android TVs, Smart Phones etc..


to find out the java version that is installed in our system trigger
java -version

software version analysis
major  minor  updates or patches
1   .   8  .  0_371

After the installation of JDK the first thing we need to do is setting the path environment varible.(or updating the path environment variable)

D>Developmentsoftwares>JDK8>bin || copy this folder location from the address bar

Right click on this pc -> properties -> AdvancedSystemSettings -> EnvironmentVariable - UserLevel -> select the path variable if already existing
and click on edit -> click on new -> paste the copied path of bin folder -> click on ok and in all the remaining windows.

if the path variable is created yet -> under user variable section -> click on new ->variable name 'path' uppercase of lowercase or mixed case but dont give any spaces in the beginning or in the middle or at end.
->variable value -> paste the copied bin folder location 

close the previously opened command prompt(before the path setting or path updation). open a new command prompt and trigger javac

Need of setting the path
------------------
in order to specify the commands location(java, javac) to the command window we need to set the path.


Installing EditPlus for the development and Learning Java Concepts through programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://www.editplus.com/ -> Select Download from top menu 
   you will get these two options
   
	EditPlus 5.7 Evaluation Version
	● Download EditPlus 5.7 (64-bit) == if your system is 64 bit architecture, then download this.
	● More options... ==> Select this if your system is 32 bit architecture. then download.
2. Before Installing, create a folder called EditPlus inside the DevelopmentSoftwares folder.
   (in windows to create a new folder shortcut cntl + shift + n)
    while developing the folder name or file name follow the CamelCase Ex:(EditPlus). the first letter     of each word will be in the upper-case without giving any space.
Note:: All the develoment softwares we are installing in the D drive(any drive other than C drive) because we need to lower the OS load, because the OS drive is already having OS files. its not recommended to give more load to that drive.
3. Start the installation by double-clicking on editplus.exe file(downloaded).
   (Note: '.exe' is an executable file in the windows system)
4. Installation Windows
   1. Accept the Licence Agreement.
   2. click on yes for the windows notification(for making the changes to the system).
   3. Next window: specify directories where you want to install. in this window just leave all the       selected check boxes as it is, then for the program directory, already the installer is       pointing default loacation 'C:\Program Files\EditPlus' instead going with this default location       select the folder location that we already created 'D:\Developmentsoftwares\EditPlus' for this       select the three '...' which is visible after the path indicator.  
      - Expand This PC -> Expand D drive -> DevelopmentSoftwares -> Then Select EditPlus folder ->         then click on OK
      - installation program directory should be looking like this 'D:\Developmentsoftwares\EditPlus'
      - click on 'Start Copy'
   4. In the Next window you will get a success message. Just click on OK.

5. Go to desktop(cntrl + D(all the opened windows will be minimized, desktop will be visible)). 
6. Double click on EditPlus application shortcut 
7. When you open the EditPlus for the first time after installation you will get License AgreementWindow Again, you just need to click on Yes to accept.
8. You will get Set Directories window - this one is related to the Internal EditPlus files storage.
   you just need to click on OK
9. you will get a small window saying that 'Setup will overwrite the existing syntax files' Continue?
   Just click on Yes.
10. EditPlus is not 100% free but we can able to use as free for the life time with minor task.
11. you will get Enter Registration Code window -> Trial -> you will get a small window called     evaluation version. you just need to drag that window to the bottom of the screen, till it is not     visible any more. Then maximize the main window. close the side bar(file Explorer) by dragging to     the left side.
12. We need to make some configuration to the EditPlus.
    click on Tools -> Preferences -> select General -> Fonts -> FontFamily = consolas, FontStyle =     Bold, FontSize = 22
    on the left hand-side categories, Select File Uncheck the option 'create the backup file while     saving'(To avoid EditPlus creating backup files for all the files). Then click on Apply and click     on OK.(To save the changes)


Developing our first java program using simple notepad
-----------------------------------------------------
1. On the desktop create a folder called JavaDemo.
2. Open the windows NotePad(click on windows icon(bottom left corner)start typing notepad and pin to    task bar. and click on the notepad icon on the task bar)
3. To increase the font size in the notepad press cntl + mouse(scrollUp).
4. start developing the HelloWorld Java Program
class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
5. copy the class name 'HelloWorld' -> File -> Save As -> Desktop > JavaDemo -> Enter the file name
  'Just paste class name whichever you copied'-> compulsary include the '.java' extension.
   Note: For the Java files .java is the extension(Java files will be identified with the .java file    extension). -> click on save.
6. Open the command prompt -> make the prompt to point to the 'Desktop > JavaDemo' Folder
   Note: Folder == Directory by using command cd Desktop/JavaDemo or if it is not working use the     command cd OneDrive/Desktop/JavaDemo.
   Note: cd (change directory)
7. To compile the java program we need to trigger the command called javac, this will be invoking the    java compiler to check for the syntax correctness of the java file.
   Note: javac (java compiler)
   Ex: javac JavaFileName.java == javac HelloWorld.java
8. If the program is syntactically proper, then a '.class' file will be generated in the same folder   (JavaDemo). Otherwise we will get syntax error. we need to resolve that error, save the file and    again we need to trigger 'javac JavaFileName.java'.
9. check the JavaDemo folder for '.class' file. select that .class file and Open that file by right    clicking and select EditPlus. 
   Note: if you cant able to see the extenstions of the files then click on view -> select the check      box of file name extensions.
   We cant able to read the contents of the .class file. this is exactly what we call the byte code.
   inside the .class byte code will be there. we need to execute the .class file.
10. For Executing the .class file -> use the java command 'java name_of_the_class_file'
    Ex: java HelloWorld
11. From the same location 'C:\Users\vijay\Desktop\JavaDemo>' trigger 'java HelloWorld'
    you will be getting 'Hello World!' as the output
    Note: you should not include any .class or .java extension while executing the class file.
12. Once you trigger java HelloWorld -> JVM(Java Virtual Machine) will be invoking the main method of     HelloWorld class and executing the print statement which is producting Hello World! as the output.
   
   Some More Configuration to the EditPlus
   ------------------------------------------
  1. Problem - if we are having more content in the same line then we need to scroll to the right-hand                side.
     Sol - To avoid this problem we need to turn on word-wrap 
     steps  -  click on Document -> Select word-wrap
  2. To get more Editor space turn off -> Ruler, that is visible on top of the Editor space.
     steps: click on view -> uncheck 'Ruler'
  3. To get the FullScreenWindow -> just press F11(toggle for interchange)


Note: if you making any changes to the java file(even minor changes like adding or removing the space)       then compulsory you need to save that file and again you need to compile that file before       executing with java command.


      Windows NotePad  VS EditPlus
 --------------------------------------
1. While saving the files Auto Extenstion will not be applied in case of notepad.
2. There is no syntax highlighting feature(color highlighting) in notepad so we may not be easily able    to recognize keywords, identifiers, inbuilt classes.
3. There are no extra fetures in notepad which are available in the EditPlus like LineNumber, Ruler,        Easy navigation between files using inbuilt package explorer and so many other tools that are very      much required for the efficient and faster development of programs.

   Task --> Develop 5 Programs with the class and file name as
   1. HelloWorld1 -> output should be Hello World 1!
   2. HelloWorld2 -> output should be Hello World 2!
   3. HelloWorld3 -> output should be Hello World 3!
   4. HelloWorld4 -> output should be Hello World 4!

Note: No need of opening and closing the command prompts again and again for each and every program you can just use the same command prompt for all the programs.

Standard Way of Developing Java Programs 
-----------------------------------
1. Create a folder in any of the drive other than OS drive, Name it as JavaCourse.
2. Inside the JavaCourse create another folder LanguageFundamentals -> application1 -> src & classes
3. src stands for source(folder)
4. We are creating a seperate folders. for keeping .java files in the src folder and to keep    generated .class files in the classes folder.
   Reason: We are seperating '.class' files from '.java' files.
             '.java' files in a seperate folder called 'src'.
	 '.class' files in a seperate folder called 'classes'.
              This is the standard way of developing our java programs.

First Approach
----------------
C:\Users\vijay>G:

G:\>cd SomeFolderName

G:\SomeFolderName>cd JavaCourseJune

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune>cd LanguageFundamentals

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals>cd application1

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals\application1>cd src

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals\application1\src> 

- Open the EditPlus File -> New -> Java
- you will be gettting the default code (recommended to delete(ctrl + A and backspace) and type       again).
- File -> Save As -> Save it in the 'G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals            \application1\src>' folder with FileName as A (.java extension is optional here bcz already              editplus selecting Save as type to .java)
-compile the file using javac FileName.java
-if our program syntactically proper then .class file will be generated. In this case .class file is generated in the same folder(src).
- To get the FileNameExtenstions in the windows FileExplorer Just View -> Select the checkbox for 
   FileNameExtenstions.
  Type: JAVA File == JAVA Source File (Java Source Code File)
          CLASS File == Compiled version of Java Source File (.class file) Which contains byte code.
          we cant able to read it, so we are chieving security. This file will be processed by the JVM.
          This file is platform independent(specifically the content of this file).
- Both the files .java and .class are present in the same src folder itself, which is not a standard way   develpment.

Second Approach
---------------
C:\Users\vijay>cd G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals\application1\src

C:\Users\vijay>G:

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals\application1\src>

Third Approach
-------------
1. select and copy the address of src folder location from the windows explorer.
   Ex: G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals\application1\src
2. open a new command prompt type cd and paste the content you just copied.
   Ex: cd G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\LanguageFundamentals\application1\src
3. if you are still not that drive and folder, just type the name of the drive and colon Ex: G:

Fourth Approach
---------------
1. Go to the src folder location in the windows explorer and clear the address bar content.
2. Just type cmd in the upper case or lower case and press enter.
   In this location command prompt will be opening.
3. to increase the font size of the command prompt just press cntrl + mouse(scroll up)


Note: - create a new java file in editplus press Alt + F and right arrow and select java
        - To save file cntrl + S 
Note - to clear the command prompt window just trigger the command 'cls'

   To seperate the .class files from the .java files while compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. javac -d ../classes B.java
   javac == java compiler
   -d == option we are using along with the javac command.
           this option is for interacting with the file system.
   ../classes ==> currently we are in the src folder. to go back to the previous folder application1                     folder, and select classes folder. In this location we need to keep the generated .class                file.
   B.java ==> the fileName we wish to compile.

**Note: you need to trigger this command from the src location only**

Runnnig the .class file
-------------------
1st Approach
------------
src>cd ../classes
application1\classes> java B
(java classFileName)

To go back to the src
----------------
cd ../src

2nd and best Approach (easier)
------------
java -cp ../classes B

 java ==> to invoke the JVM
   -cp ==> option 'classpath' -> it will be seaching for .class files in the directory.
   ../classes B ==>   currently we are in the src folder. to go back to the previous folder application1                     folder, and select classes folder. there you will find class file, that file we need to 	                   execute.

Task  ==> Create 4 java files and compile and execute using the steps showed above
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. C.java
2. D.java
3. E.java
4. F.java 

Note: To rename the file or folder press F2 in windows.

public class demostration
----------------------
1. public is a keyword in java.
   Note: - keywords are having speacial meaning to the java language itself.
          - Keywords are also called as reserved words.
           There are about 50 keyword are available in Java 8
            1. abstract
	2. assert
	3. boolean
	4. break
	5. byte
	6. case
	7. catch
	8. char
	9. class
	10. const(NOT USED)
	11. continue
	12. default
	13. do
	14. double
	15. else
 	16. enum
	17. extends
	18. final
	19. finally
	20. float
	21. for
	22. goto(NOT USED)
	23. if
	24. implements
	25. import
	26. instanceof
	27. int
	28. interface
	29. long
	30. native
	31. new
	32. package
	33. private
	34. protected
	35. public
	36. return
 	37. short
	38. static
	39. strictfp
	40. super
	41. switch
	42. synchronized
	43. this
	44. throw
	45. throws
	46. transient
	47. try
	48. void
	49. volatile
	50. while
**Note: There are 3 reserved literals -> 1.null 2. true 3. false **
**Note: each keyword is having a specific functionality**
**Note: 'goto' and 'const' are NOT USED(deprecated) even though these two keywords are present in the Java 8, we are not using those keywords. due to the guidlines provided by the Java Developers. because of language improvements reasons**

- while compiling a java file you should compile it with java file name itself, NOT the class name which   is present in the java file.
- In a Java file if you are declaring a class with public keyword then that public class name should be   the file name, otherwise  you will get error.
- If we are not declaring a class as public then file name can be anything. 
  while compiling we need to compile with filename but while executing we need to execute with the        class name which generated inside the classes folder.

- The initial task of the JVM is to invoke the main method of that class.
- Main method is considered as starting point of a program(execution starts from the main   method)**Generally 
  Note: before the main method we can also execute some of the members which are static   members.

class B 
{
}
-defined
-concrete
-implemented
-complete body

Note: the above program is syntactically proper.

Note: public keyword is used as an access specifier.

- if the class is not having a main method we cant able to run that class.
- in one java file we can able to develop any no. of classes.
- if none of the classes are declared with public keyword then file name can be anything.
- if at least one class is declared as 'public' then that class name must be the file name.
- in one java file maximum 0 or 1 public class is allowed not more than that.

for the folder seperation in windows '\' will be used
------------------------------------------
G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\2.public_class\classes

in the windows only but in the command prompt while the user specifying the path should be be using '/' thats only recognized in the command prompt for navigation by the user
-------------------------------------
src>java -cp ../classes T

Note: even some of the cross platform softwares will supporting both the characters '/''\'

Note: In the browser address bar we will be using '/' for seperation
       Ex: https://www.google.com/chrome/download
Note: Linux will be using '/' for directory seperation

NOTE:  Learn typing ==> https://www.speedcoder.net/
         you should maintain at least 60WPM
         
	IDENTIFIERS - In Java
----------------------------------
Defintion: - To identify something by using a name in java programming we can use                          identifiers.
	- An identifier is a name given to a class, method, variable and other               programming elements to uniquely identify them within their context.

Navigation using command prompt
----------------------------

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\2.public_class\src>cd ..

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\2.public_class>cd ..

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals>cd 3.identifiers

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\3.identifiers>cd src

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\2.public_class\src>cd ../../3.identifiers/src

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\3.identifiers\src>cd ../.../2.public_class/src
The system cannot find the path specified.

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\3.identifiers\src>cd ../../2.public_class/src

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\2.public_class\src>cd ../../3.identifiers/src

G:\SomeFolderName\JavaCourseJune\1.LanguageFundamentals\3.identifiers\src>
_______________________________________________________________

Def: A name Java programming to identify something by using an unique name is called identifier Ex:class name, method name, variable name 
Rules and possibilities for developing Identifiers
_____________________________
1. STANDARD: Follow the camel case while developing class name.Ex: HelloWorld
     Note: class name is also an identifier.
2. Identifier name must not start with a digit(number). Ex:1HelloWorld, 123total ==> not possible
3. Identifier name can have a digit in the middle.Ex: Hello2World ==> possible
4. Identifier name can have a digit at the last in the identifier name. Ex: HelloWorld3 ==>     possible.
5. In the identifiers except $ and _ there are no other special characters are allowed. 
   Ex: *HelloWorld ==> not possible
        ___Hello___ ==>possible
        $$Hello$$ ==>possible
        __Hello$$ ==> possible
6. Alphabets (a-z & A-Z)
7. digits (0-9)
8. keywords cant be used as identifiers.
9. we can develop the identifier name with any length.But keep it simple and meaningful.
10. we cant have the space in the middle of the identifier.
11. we can able to use inbuilt class names and interfaces names as identifiers. even though it is valid to use predefined java class names and interface names as identifiers it is not recommended because it leads to the confusion.  
12. Java identifiers are case sensitive.


Note: its possible to create a java file without any content in that file. Compilation will be success.(developing empty java file is possible), but you dont get the class file.


print VS println
______________________________________________
1. In case of 'println' cursor will be coming to the "next line". i,e after printing the content of the print statment, because of the 'ln' cursor comes to the next line.
2. println is method
   Note: System is class, out is an object, println is a method.
3. In case of 'print' cursor will not comes to the "next line". i,e after printing the content of the print statment,  because of 'just print and without ln' cursor will be staying in the same location.
Note: print is also a method
Note: In General we call print and println statements as 'print statment' but there will a different method for 'next line' and 'without next line'
Note: 'next line' is also called as 'new line'
Note: print and println both will be interacting with the "standard output stream"
       There are maily three streams in Java
       1. Standard Input Stream
       2. Standard Output Stream
       3. Standard Error Stream
- In Java ';' indicates that end of a statement.
  Note: if you are not ending a statement with a semicolon then you will be getting CTE.
         - CTE(Compile Time Error or Compilation Error)
-Note: console == command prompt == terminal


   ***********Literals in Java**********
___________________________________
- Literal is a values that can be assigned to a variable.
- Literals represent fixed values that cannot be changed during the exection of the   program.
  Java Supports several types of literals
  1. Integer Literal - A number without any decimal points(number of -ve or +ve)
  2. Floating Literal - A number which has a decimal point
  3. Character Literal - A single character within a pair of single quots
  4. Boolean Literal - true and false
  5. String Literal - multiple characters within a pair of double quots
  6. Null Literal - null is also a literal, that can be assigned to a reference variable.

Basic MathOperators
----------------------
- we can perform mathematical operations inside the SOP

syntax: operand operator operand 
Ex:      10       +           10
          20       -           10

- in case of '/' you will get quotient value
- in case of '%' you will get remainder

______________________Datatypes and Variables_______________________
Datatype is nothing but a type of data
In Java we have 2 types
1. primitive datatypes
2. non-primitive datatype

primitive datatypes ==> 8 
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
7. boolean
8. character

non-primitive datatypes ==> reference type, user type

________variables________
 - In order to store the varying data we need a variable
      _________________In case of primitive datatypes_______________
 SYNTAX: datatype variableName assignmentOperator literal;
        Ex: int          i                =                   10; 
        ==> int i = 10;

Note: = is the assignment operator. left side assignment.
Note: variable is also an identifier

int i; ==> variable declaration
i = 10; ==> initialization
System.out.println(i); ==> usage

____JavaConvention____
class name ==> always starts with a uppercase letter and follows camel case.
                 Ex: HelloWorld
variable and method name ==> always starts with a lowercase letter and follows camel case.
                 Ex: thisIsTheVariableIdentifierExample
                 Ex: thisIsTheMethodNameExample()

Note: Java compiler ignores the white spaces.
       we can use the whitespaces for better readiability.

- By default the decimal values are considered as double type.
- By default in java decimal values are considered as double types only not float type.
- to supply the decimal values for float datatype just include either 'f' or 'F' after the decimal value. then compiler will be considering that value as float value.
___________
int i; ==> declaration
i = 10;  ==> first time initialization
System.out.println(i);==> usage
i = 20; ==> re-initialization
System.out.println(i); ==>usage
i = 0; ==> re-initialization
System.out.println(i); ==>usage
i = -100; ==> re-initialization
System.out.println(i); ==>usage

Note: a variable can be re-initialized any no. of times.
_______________

byte < short < int < long < float < double

byte ==> -128 to 127
short ==> -32768 to 32767
int ==> -2147483648 to 2147483647
long ==> -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
float ==> 1.40239846e-45f to 3.40282347e+38f
double ==> 4.94065645841246544e-324 to 1.79769313486231570e+308

___________________String concatination_________________
String can be added to anything. Anything can be added to String


- In a single line by using ',' as seperator we can declare any no. of varables,   and initialize as well. but that should be of the same type.

Note: c4 = c6 = 'c'; ==> compound assignment

- before the usage of local variables compulsary it should be initialized.
  - local variables must be initialized before usage.


___________________String-Concatination________________
- Concatination is the process of adding anything with the string or adding string   with anything.
- Concatination referes to the process of combining or joining two or more strings   together to create a single string.
- we can combine strings with other data types like numbers or variables.
- In java the most common way to concatenate strings is by using the '+' operator.

Note: by default the whole number is considered as int values only. and we should follow the int range otherwise you will get integer number is too large.

Note: Java is case sensitive. 
      Ex: variable and VARIABLE or VaRiAbLe ==> all are not same. They are           different.

(result1 == result2 == result3);
 true == false == false
 false == false ==> true


Note: we can just declare the local variables without initializing it as long as yo       dont use them.
      if you are trying to use local variables without initializing then you will       get an error.
Note: local variables are local to that declared methods only, they will not be       visible outside of the declared methods.
      in otherwords local variables scope is limited to the declared methods only.


________________comments-in-java_____________
- comments are developed for the information puropose about a particular line of   code or code snippet or about the whole document.
- comments are ignored by the compiler.
- comments are used for documentation and explanatory purpose. 
- comments not executed as part of the program's logic and do not affect the   program functionality(execution).
 
There are three of comments in java
----------------------------------------
1. single line comment
   Ex: //This is a single line comment

2. multiline comment(block comment)
   Ex: /* any no. of lines of code */

3. documentation comment(for generating API documentation kind of things)
/*
*some info
*some info
*some info
*some info
*/


___________________________UNARY OPERATORS_______________________
INCREMENT AND DECREMENT
PRE-POST      PRE-POST


- in case post (increment, decrement) - the modified value will be affected from     the next usage not from current usage(immediate usage)
  i, e wherever the operation is going on there the value remains same, from the     next usage the modified value will be applied.

- in case of pre(increment, decrement) - the modified value will be immedeately
  applied. 
  i, e wherever the operation is going on there itself the modified value will be   applied.
